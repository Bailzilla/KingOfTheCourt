# KingOfTheCourt

## What is this project?
A 1-on-1 basketball game simulator. Players battle head to head in a game to 12. When the application is run, a game is simulated. The results will be displayed, along with the shooting percentage for each player and a list of follow-up commands. The user can choose to play another game, look at the play-by-play from the previous game, or exit the program. 

### Requirements
1. This project is on GitHub with more than 5 commits
2. This project has a README
3. 2 objects of the Hooper class are created and populated with data. This information is then used variously throughout the application
4. Methods for the Hooper class include Shoot(), madeShot(), and missedShot(). Shoot() returns a truthy value reflecting a made or missed shot attempt 

### Features
1. Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
2. Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent
3. Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
4. Use a LINQ query to retrieve information from a data structure (such as a list or array) or file
